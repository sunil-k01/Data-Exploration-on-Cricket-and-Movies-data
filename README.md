# Data Exploration Project

## Overview
This project involves exploring two datasets: IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket matches and movies. The analysis includes various queries and insights extracted from the datasets using Python libraries such as NumPy and pandas.

## Libraries Used
- NumPy
- pandas

## Dataset
The project utilizes two datasets:
1. `ipl-matches.csv`: Contains data related to IPL cricket matches.
2. `movies.csv`: Contains data related to movies.

## Analysis Highlights
1. **Final Winners**: Identified champions of each IPL season.
2. **Super Over Finishes**: Analyzed rare occurrences of matches decided by super overs.
3. **CSK in Kolkata**: Examined Chennai Super Kings' performance in Kolkata venues.
4. **Toss Impact**: Analyzed the correlation between toss wins and match wins.
5. **High-rated Movies**: Identified critically acclaimed movies with significant viewer engagement.
6. **Action Movie Ratings**: Explored the quality of action movies based on audience ratings.
7. **Player of the Match**: Recognized outstanding players in crucial IPL matches.
8. **Toss Decision Trends**: Visualized teams' preferences regarding toss decisions.
9. **Team Performance**: Evaluated each IPL team's participation and success rate.
10. **Batsman Rankings**: Ranked IPL batsmen based on their performance.
11. **Virat Kohli's Last Match**: Identified the venue and opponent of Virat Kohli's most recent match in Delhi.

## Usage
To replicate the analysis or explore the datasets further, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries: NumPy and pandas.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`exploration.ipynb`) to view the analysis and code implementation.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate additional datasets for comparative analysis.
- Enhance visualization techniques for better insights.
- Implement machine learning models for predictive analysis.
